<pre class="doc">The Distributor is responsible for actually delivering an event to the
desired subscriptions.

A distributor should attempt to avoid blocking; using subprocesses is
preferred to threads.

Each distributor handles a single transport, and only one distributor
in the system should handle that. For example, there should not be
two distributors for the 'email' transport.</pre>
