<pre class="doc">Represents a single 'box' in the Announcements preference panel.

Any component can always implement IPreferencePanelProvider to get
preferences from users, of course. However, considering there may be
several components related to the Announcement system, and many may
have different preferences for a user to set, that would clutter up
the preference interfac quite a bit.

The IAnnouncementPreferenceProvider allows several boxes to be
chained in the same panel to group the preferenecs related to the
Announcement System.

Implementing announcement preference boxes should be essentially
identical to implementing entire panels.</pre>
