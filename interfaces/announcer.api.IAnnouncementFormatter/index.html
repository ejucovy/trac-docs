<pre class="doc">Formatters are responsible for converting an event into a message
appropriate for a given transport.

For transports like 'aim' or 'irc', this may be a short summary of a
change. For 'email', it may be a plaintext or html overview of all
the changes and perhaps the existing state.

It's up to a formatter to determine what ends up ultimately being sent
to the end-user. It's capable of pulling data out of the target object
that wasn't changed, picking and choosing details for whatever reason.

Since a formatter must be intimately familiar with the realm that
originated the event, formatters are tied to specific transport + realm
combinations. This means there may be a proliferation of formatters as
options expand.</pre>
