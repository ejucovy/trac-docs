<pre class="doc">The static ticket decorator implements a policy to -always- send an
email to a certain address.

Controlled via the always_cc and always_bcc option in the announcer section
of the trac.ini.  If no subscribers are found, then even if always_cc and
always_bcc addresses are specified, no announcement will be sent.  Since
these fields are added after announcers subscription system, filters such
as never_announce and never_notify author won't work with these addresses.

These settings are considered dangerous if you are using the verify email
or reset password features of the accountmanager plugin.</pre>
